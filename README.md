# Introduction

Hello viewer and welcome to my submission for Challenge 4 aka the pandas-challenge. For context, at the time of writing this, I am enrolled in the Data Analytics and Visualizations bootcamp with the University of MN. We are assigned a challenge homework per module. This is Module 4's challenge on Python. I am using a windows/PC laptop.

# Overview

In this specific challenge we were pretending to be a new chief data scientist for a public city school district. I believe the original name is PyCity Schools district but to make it fun for and unique to me, I will be referring to the district as Los Angellis Schools District which is pun with the City of Losangeles and my first and last name. In this challenge, we were to help the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities by analyzing data and drawing conclusions. We were given a challenge image, two sets of data in separate csv files named "schools_complete" and "students_complete," and a sample solution template to work from called "PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb."

# Additional Information/Citations

In this repository, you will find the "PyCitySchools" folder that holds my script and another folder named "Images" that contains pictures of the outcome tables from my code. You will also find the "Starter_Code_Reference" folder that holds the sample solution template "PyCitySchools_start.ipynb," a folder named Images with the challenge image in it, and a folder named "PyCitySchools/Resources" where the two csv files are. Special shout out to my tutor Geronimo Perez who helped me get started and guided me through the first part of the challenge. I was out of town while working on this challenge and forgot my notebook at home so this time around I had to rely on websearches and deeply review class materials and class activities. More specifically 4.2 "Exploring Pandas" and 4.3 "Merging and Data Cleaning." This assignment took me about 2 days off and on and I would not have been able to do it so quickly without the template provided (Thank you so much to program staff who created it). As always, a big shout out to my bootcamp TAs Sam and Randy for all their help answering my questions during office hours, my instructor Hunter for always being clear in his articulation of the course material, and my classmates for their encouragement and support.
